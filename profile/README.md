## Geoloupix

### Introduction

Geoloupix is an app to share your location or specific locations to your friends for free. We (don't) believe our project is different from others and is useful in any cases
Geoloupix team is composed of 2 french young and talented devs :

#### Florian L
I'm a French self-taught fullstack developer. I enjoy designing and creating beautiful, functional websites as well as mobile apps. 
I've been coding for more than 2 years now. I've been working on yNotes lately, a school life mobile application that connects French students to their school services.
I'm in my last year of high school and I'm about to study web development next year. One of my hobbies is playing drums and percussions in several bands.

#### Marc M
Hmmm,  why can't I just copy past what he just wrote ? As you can guess, I'm a French self-taught backend developer. I hate css and js. I do really hate that shit but thankfully Florian does that for me
I lack of social interactions and friend for now 4 years and I've been learning PHP and a buch of stuff for now 4 years...
I don't have a recent project, I missed them and when Florian asked me to help and create this project I said yeah !
What I like outside coding is watching animes and going out with my friends !
